# Aspose.OMR for Cloud

[Aspose.OMR for Cloud](https://products.aspose.cloud/omr/cloud) is a REST API that helps you to perform optical mark recognition in the cloud. You can get [binaries](https://github.com/asposecloud/Aspose.OMR-Cloud/releases) to **start** working **immediately** and recognize various OMR forms. 
Developers can embed optical recognition in any type of application to extract data from images of tests, exams, questionnaires, surveys, etc. In the repository you can find examples on how to start using Aspose.OMR API in your project. 



## Contents

The repository contains sample applications that demonstrate how to perform common OMR with Aspose.OMR API.

Directory | Description
--------- | -----------
[ConsoleClient](ConsoleClient)  | A .NET 2.0 console application that demonstrates main Aspose.OMR for Cloud functionality.
[Aspose.OMR.Client](OMRclient)  | An open source .NET application with GUI that helps you work with OMR templates and perform OMR operations.
[TestFiles](TestFiles) | Sample images and templates that demonstrate how OMR works on real data.



## Quickstart

You can perform tasks out of the box without writing a single line of code. That requires two simple steps:


### 1. Receive Cloud Keys
Aspose.Cloud credentials are required to use Aspose.OMR for Cloud API. You can acquire App SID and App Key by registrating at [Aspose Cloud Dashboard](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/). It will take only a couple of minutes.

### 2. Get OMR Client
Check [releases](https://github.com/asposecloud/Aspose.OMR-Cloud/releases) section and download MSI package that installs OMR.Client. Using this GUI application you can create OMR templates, correct or update existing OMR templates and perform optical mark recognition using Aspose.OMR.Cloud engine. 

More info and documentation can be found at: [Client documentation](https://docs.aspose.cloud/display/omrcloud/Aspose.OMR.Client+Application)


## Using OMR Cloud API in your projects
It is quite easy to use OMR in your projects. All you need to do is:

1. Get [Aspose Cloud](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/) credentials - App Key and App Sid.
2. Install Aspose.OMR Cloud SDK via [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspose.OMR-Cloud/).
3. Use OMR.Client to create templates or use one from [our examples](https://github.com/asposecloud/Aspose.OMR-Cloud/tree/master/TestFiles).
3. Start using [OMR functions](https://docs.aspose.cloud/display/omrcloud/API+Specifications) and get recognition results.


Check [Console Client](https://github.com/asposecloud/Aspose.OMR-Cloud/tree/master/ConsoleClient) solution for a simple demonstration of how OMR functions can be called from your code.
